# Currency-Converter
Creating a currency converter app in React that fetches real-time exchange rates from an API is a great project to learn about making API requests and handling state in React.
Step 1: Set Up a New React App

If you haven't already set up a new React app, you can use Create React App:

npx create-react-app currency-converter
cd currency-converter

Step 2: Install Axios

You'll need Axios to make API requests. Install it in your project:

npm install axios

Step 3: Create the CurrencyConverter Component

In your src directory, create a new component named CurrencyConverter.js. This component will handle the conversion logic and user interface.

use currency.jsx code

Step 4: Add the CurrencyConverter Component to App.js

In src/App.js, import and use the CurrencyConverter component:

Step 5: Start the Development Server

Start the development server to see your currency converter app in action:

npm start


Now, you should have a basic currency converter app that fetches exchange rates based on the selected base currency (default is USD). Users can input an amount, select the base and target currencies, and see the converted amount in real-time.

Remember to handle any styling and additional features as needed to make your app more user-friendly and visually appealing.
